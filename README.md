# Named Entity Recognition (NER) NLP Project for Farsi Dataset

This project focuses on developing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system specifically designed for the Farsi (Persian) language. NER is a crucial task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities such as persons, organizations, and locations within text data.

## Implementation Method

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
- **Farsi Dataset Acquisition**: Collect labeled text data in Farsi from various sources such as news articles, social media posts, or specialized corpora.
- **Data Annotation**: Annotate the collected dataset with named entities and their corresponding categories (e.g., PER for person, ORG for organization) using annotation tools like Label Studio or Brat Annotation Tool.

### 2. Model Training
- **Preprocessing**: Perform preprocessing on the Farsi text data, including tokenization, normalization, and encoding to prepare it for model training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features from the text data, such as word embeddings and character-level embeddings, to capture Farsi language-specific characteristics.

### 3. Model Architecture
- **TensorFlow**: Utilize TensorFlow to build and train the NER model. Ensure compatibility with GPU acceleration to speed up training.
- **Model Structure**: Implement a suitable model architecture for NER, such as a Bidirectional LSTM with a CRF layer or a Transformer-based model like BERT, fine-tuned for Farsi.

### 4. Training the Model
- **Training Setup**: Define the training parameters, including batch size, epochs, and callbacks for monitoring the training process and saving the best model checkpoints.
- **Callbacks**: Use callbacks like early stopping to prevent overfitting, and TensorBoard for visualizing training progress and performance metrics.

### 5. Model Evaluation and Fine-Tuning
- **Validation**: Evaluate the trained model on a validation set to measure its performance on unseen Farsi text data.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjust model hyperparameters and architecture based on evaluation results to improve NER performance.

### 6. Model Deployment
- **Inference**: Deploy the trained NER model to perform entity recognition on new Farsi text data.
- **Integration**: Integrate the NER system into applications or workflows that process Farsi language text, such as information extraction from documents or social media analysis.

## Tools Used

### Python Libraries
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualizing data.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.
- **Livelossplot**: For live plotting of training metrics in Jupyter notebooks.

### Docker
- **Docker**: Used to create reproducible and isolated environments for running the NER system, ensuring consistency across different setups.
